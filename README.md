# biggie

biggie is the last mile of [big](https://github.com/tmcw/big). It turns Markdown into slides,
and slides into a website, and even posts it online for you with the magic of
[bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/) and [gist](http://gist.github.com).

## develop

    git@github.com:tmcw/biggie.git

Then dependencies

    npm install

I tend to use the [watch](http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl1_watch.htm)
utility, so in one terminal,

    watch make

And in the other

    serve

(or any other [simple development server](https://gist.github.com/tmcw/4989751)).
